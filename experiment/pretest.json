      "question": "Which of the following is a closed figure?",

        "a": "Ellipse",
        "b": "Hyperbola",
        "c": "Parabola",
        "d": "Circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "An ellipse is a closed curve that forms a complete loop, unlike hyperbolas and parabolas which are open curves that extend infinitely. The ellipse is bounded and encloses a finite area, making it the only closed figure among the conic sections listed."

        "d": "Volume"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Eccentricity (e) defines the shape and type of conic section: e = 0 for a circle, 0 < e < 1 for an ellipse, e = 1 for a parabola, and e > 1 for a hyperbola. It measures how much the conic deviates from being circular."

      "question": "The section obtained when the cone is cut by a plane at an angle of 90° with the axis is called ____?",
      "answers": {

        "b": "Hyperbola",
        "c": "Parabola",
        "d": "Circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "When a plane cuts a cone perpendicular to its axis (at 90°), the resulting cross-section is a circle. This occurs because all points on the cutting plane are equidistant from the cone's axis, creating a perfect circular shape."

      "question": "A parabola has a single focus and a single directrix.",

        "a": "True",
        "b": "False",
        "c": "Only for vertical parabolas",
        "d": "Only for horizontal parabolas"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is true. By definition, a parabola is the locus of all points equidistant from a single fixed point (focus) and a single fixed line (directrix). This is what distinguishes a parabola from ellipses and hyperbolas, which have two foci."

        "c": "Focus",
        "d": "Center"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "The vertex is the point where the conic section intersects its axis of symmetry. For a parabola, it's the turning point; for an ellipse or hyperbola, there are typically two vertices where the curve intersects the major axis."

      "question": "Mathematically, an ellipse is illustrated by the equation ____?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "x² / a² + y² / b² = 1",
        "b": "x²= 4ay",
        "c": "x²/ a² – y² / b² = 1",
        "d": "x² + y² = r²"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, where 'a' and 'b' are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The plus sign between the terms distinguishes it from a hyperbola, which uses a minus sign."

      "question": "What does the equation y = 4x² + 3x + 5 represent?",

        "b": "Circle",
        "c": "Ellipse",
        "d": "Hyperbola"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This equation represents a parabola because it's a quadratic equation in x (highest power is 2) with y as a linear function of x². The general form y = ax² + bx + c always represents a parabola opening upward (if a > 0) or downward (if a < 0)."

        "c": "Ellipse",
        "d": "Circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "This equation represents a hyperbola because it follows the standard form (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1, where the minus sign between the x² and y² terms is the key identifier. Here, a² = 36 and b² = 9, so a = 6 and b = 3."
