    {
      "question": "What is the eccentricity if the distance from the directrix is 50 units and the distance from the focus is 20 units?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.8",
        "b": "0.2",
        "c": "0.5",
        "d": "0.4"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "Eccentricity e = distance from focus / distance from directrix = 20 / 50 = 0.4.",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "For hyperbola, the ratio of the distance of point from the focus to the distance of point from the directrix is____?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Equal to 1 ",
        "b": "Greater than 1",
        "c": "Less than 1 ",
        "d": "None of the above "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "The eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1, so the ratio is also greater than 1.",

    {
      "question": "Which of the following conic section is formed if the distance of point from the directrix is 35 units and the distance of point from the focus is 45 units? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Hyperbola ",
        "b": "Parabola ",
        "c": "Ellipse ",
        "d": "Circle "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "Since the focus distance is greater than the directrix distance, eccentricity > 1 â†’ hyperbola.",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the conic section if formed, if the eccentricity is 0.333 ",

        "c": "Ellipse ",
        "d": "Circle "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "If eccentricity is less than 1 but more than 0, the conic is an ellipse.",

      "question": "The eccentricity of a circle is ____.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1",

      "question": "Which of the following statement is correct? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The distance between the foci of an ellipse is the minor axis.",
        "b": "The distance between the foci of an ellipse is twice the length of the major axis.",
        "c": "The distance between the foci of an ellipse is the major axis. ",
        "d": "The distance between the foci of an ellipse is twice the length of the minor axis."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "The correct relationship is 2c = distance between foci, which can relate to 2b in some ellipse forms.",
